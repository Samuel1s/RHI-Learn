                    An <strong>Azure virtual network</strong> is similar to a traditional network that you'd 
                    operate in your own datacenter. It enables virtual machines and other compute resources 
                    to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

                    A <strong>network security group (NSG)</strong>
